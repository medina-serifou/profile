		<h1>Hello, I'm Médina SERIFOU</h1>
		<img src="images/profile.jpg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Médina Serifou">
		<p>
		I'm a third-year student of the BBA program at ESSEC Business School. I want to become en entrepreneur and bring something important, unique and interesting to people. For me, entrepreneurship is about adding something to people's lives. It is about solving a problem and bring something different. Thus, in my daily life, I aim to be useful to people around me.

		<h2>Learning new things </h2>
		<p>
		For me, one of the most important things in the world is the learning of new things. I feel like the things we don't know yet are so much greater than the things we are conscious about. Therefore, I am always learning, especially through reading and visiting websites.

		<h2>Imagination </h2>
		<p>
		I enjoy stimulating my imagination. Life is really boring for me so visiting new universes, new places and other people points of view's through reading and watching movies is so appealing to me. I am fond of reading fantastic and science fiction books as well as watching movies and series of this type. It just makes me travel and discover new things that I don't have access to in my natural life.

		<h2>Eating </h2>
		<p>
		How can I talk about what defines me without mentioning eating ? I am over the moon when I eat, especially when it comes to sweet food. I can't spend a whole day without eating snacks. I find it so awful the sweet food is so bad for health. It is tasty, delicious and makes me travel just like books and series do. But don't worry, I also work out regularly to stay fit so I don't get swallowed by all the sweet I eat.
